### Description: 
- Similar to how the pokedex pulled up information about your search/parameter, I want to create the same thing but for Marvel Comics.
- In the search bar, people would be able to look up comic characters, comic titles, creators, etc..
- Example: Zeb Wells (the current writer of Spider-man) is one of my favorite writers. If I searched his name with my API call, I would get a list of other Marvel comics he's written, so I could continue to support him.
- Example: If someone wanted Black Panther source material to read before the upcoming movie, I could search "Black Panther".

### How to Get Started: 
- Wireframe my "end product/goal" AKA how things should be laid out and what information it should contain
- Brainstorm and list what tools/skills/functions/methods I think I need to actualize this
- Trello my initial timeline, breaking down every single task I can think of. From start to finish. Explicitly budgeting in buffer time for office hours, mishaps, etc. 

### If time allows, extensions: 
- A "Surprise Me" search button, with MathRandon?
- A dropdown or filter option for someone looking for specific criteria (AKA if someone wanted to look for the current Daredevil comic book writer, instead of just searching for "Daredevil" there's a way to filter the search and/or results)
- Local storage of information to previous searches you had

### Credits: 
Break down sources based on category, for example: 
- HTML Sites Used
- CSS Sites Used
- Javascript Sites Used
- People Who Supported Me
- Credit Marvel Comics, since part of their API's fine print is to give them credit for source material
